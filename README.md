# Overview

Immunization Registry databases (or Immunization Information Systems) are currently managed by individual states and/or large municipalities, amounting to 56 fragmented databases that can result in duplicated and inconsistent information. 

This project serves as an exploration into methods that may improve the issues stemming from the currently siloed system by implementing an improved user-interface with a singular database driven backend. The project will focus on addressing and amending data discrepancies, and contributing to modernization and improvement initiatives including the development of a universally-recognized digital vaccination card, inventory optimization and auto-replenishment capabilities, and assessing coverage rates in the community. The regulated nature and scale of such a project would necessitate compliance with any required components mandated by the CDC, and would need to accommodate record-keeping capacity at the population-level, potentially affecting more than 332M Americans.
